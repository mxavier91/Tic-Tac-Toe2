# Tic-Tac-Toe2

When approaching this project I decided to take it day by day and working on one piece at a time. On the first day I tried to focus mainly on the HTML and CSS. I wanted to try and at least get a board and change the background color.

After working on the HTML and CSS, I worked on the game-logic. I use JavaScript and jQuery in order to get the clicks the be recognized on each "td" element.

To simplify my code, I used module.exports so that I can access code from other files and use it in another file.

The JavaScript side was definitley my most difficult task. I was really unsure of how to accomplish each task to reach requirements.
